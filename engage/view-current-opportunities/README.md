# View Current Opportunities

The Open Web Sandbox offers two types of opportunities for people who want to start engaging within the ecosystem. The first is a list of opportunities by projects already working in the NEAR ecosystem. Essentially, projects come to us to outsource some task that needs to be completed, and we offer it on our Projects Dashboard. These tasks can range from copywriting to code translation, welcoming all types of talents.&#x20;

If you want to view the list of Project Opportunities, visit the [**Projects Dashboard**](https://www.openwebsandbox.org/projects-dashboard).

Instead, if you want to view the list of our monthly OWS opportunities, jump to this part:

If you want to undertake some of the tasks offered in the OWS Opportunities page, make sure you keep our frequently-updated Quality Control Guidelines into consideration while working:&#x20;
