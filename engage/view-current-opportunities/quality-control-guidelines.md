# üìê Quality Control Guidelines

As Sandbox is rapidly growing and gaining more and more attention from the community, there is a need to ensure that all produced content is being created to the benefit of the NEAR ecosystem.&#x20;

The OWS Team has a set of guidelines that all new and old Sandboxers must follow.&#x20;

These guidelines are of mandatory character, i.e. the OWS moderators reserve the right to decline the payout request should they, at their sole discretion, deem any submitted content not to be in compliance with the guidelines listed below. The guidelines are subject to change from month to month - with clear communication of changes by the OWS Team. It is thus in the interest of the Sandboxers to&#x20;

Decentralisation implies ‚Äúcoming from all over the globe‚Äù which has certain implications on how value is being understood in different parts of the planet.

This is the first attempt by the OWS Team to consolidate different (cultural) perspectives into a solid understanding of what is valuable within the NEAR ecosystem.&#x20;

OWS will continue raising its standards to ensure a linear congruence with the expansion of the NEAR ecosystem.&#x20;

We are actively working on accumulating feedback across different layers of the NEARverse and implementing it accordingly. Please do reach out to @mecsbecs @vrdoingthings or @aluminium\_foil if you are interested in contributing to the different OWS arms and/or have constructive feedback on improvement. Thank you!
