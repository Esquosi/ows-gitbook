The Open Web Sandbox (OWS) has been built to encourage participation and collaboration on different activities in the NEAR Ecosystem allowing its members to actively engage with their own activities and other opportunities enlisted by the community.Through the OWS rewards and opportunities program (for details see Annex II) users can engage with the rest of the community and explore opportunities made available by them or the OWS. As a registered contributor, at the end of the month, the member can claim rewards for each of the activities he/she worked on. This will be evaluated by the OWS Council and the contributor receives rewards in $NEAR.For more detailed information, please see the full report below.
