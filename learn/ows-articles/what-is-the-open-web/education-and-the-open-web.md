# Education and the Open Web

Written by [4NTS](https://nearguilds.com/documentation/).&#x20;

Blockchain has steadily grown to become one of the most innovative and revolutionary technologies of the 21st century; capturing the interest of entrepreneurs, venture capital firms, financial institutions and other corporations. Blockhainâ€™s scope, however, goes well beyond the financial and business world. It has a tremendous range of use cases in every industry, education included. There are two major discussions of the field of education and blockchain technology: one is focused on applying blockchain in the educational field, and another aims at fostering education on blockchain technology. Concretely, the first field looks at how the blockchain can be used to document, verify and share data on learning, knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as the academic awards that represent them, in a more private and efficient way. The second looks at how to make blockchain adoption easier by filling the knowledge gap that prevents individuals and companies from benefiting from blockchain.

### Blockchain in Education: Ongoing Projects

As a general purpose technology, integrating blockchain with an education system can change the way diplomas are verified, academic papers checked for plagiarism, and who is able to access what classes. Educational initiatives are only starting to experiment with these new ideas, with plenty of room for development into the future.

### Blockchain Education for Business Innovation

Education, specifically about blockchain, and generally about the open-web, is still in its infancy for much of the professional and academic world. While certain business schools may feature discussions about Bitcoin or Enterprise Blockchain, there is little exposure to the rest of the world of crypto-innovation relating to NFTs, DeFi, new forms of crowdfunding and tokenization, and much more. While this especially relates to new business opportunities, it is also a topic that should be promoted across intellectual categories: In economics, finance, political science, computer science, philosophy and ethics, and much more.&#x20;

Finally, there is the prospect of an innovation imbalance between certain regions of the world: Places where blockchain and the open-web are not taught across disciplines are at risk of falling behind - not in the next ten to fifteen years, but the next twenty to forty.

### A Roadmap for Future Opportunity

Blockchain technology provides incredible opportunities for overcoming economic stagnation. As we go through the crisis and recover, the imperative should be to encourage experimentation with the aim of creating sustainability and prosperity. What has yet to be fully grasped about the Open Web is just how diverse and innovative certain crypto-based solutions can be: Non-Fungible Tokens, Validator Staking, Decentralized Finance in its many manifestations, as well as asset tokenization and fractionalization providing entirely new ways of handling value.&#x20;

The adoption of blockchain for businesses can play a fundamental role for economic recovery, but for it to succeed we need more education on this technology and fill the knowledge gap between early adopters and the rest of the population.
