# Climate Change and the Open Web

Written by [4NTS](https://nearguilds.com/documentation/).&#x20;

Blockchain is an incredibly innovative technology that is increasingly revolutionising many aspects of life. In the past years, new applications of blockchain technology have been created to fight climate change and foster sustainable development. Already in early 2017, the then Associate Program Office the United Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNCCC), Alexandre Gellert defined blockchain technology as:

> “An invaluable tool to foster greater stakeholder participation, transparency and engagement and help bring trust and new innovative solutions in the fight against climate change, leading to improved climate actions.”&#x20;
>
> __[_United Nations Climate Change_](https://unfccc.int/news/how-blockchain-technology-could-boost-climate-action)__

The main features of blockchain technology - decentralization, transparency and traceability - perfectly meet the needs of the Paris Agreement and can therefore bring effective scalability to climate action as they are able to measure, and efficiently and transparently track any type of data collected. These types of technologies could in fact ensure the equal commitment of different nations to comply with the international rules set by the agreement, making it possible to achieve political stability and cooperation at the international level on a problem such as climate change.&#x20;

There are various applications of blockchain technology that can help fighting climate change, the following are the most common:

New applications of blockchain technology are discovered by the day, and in the past years more and more startups and projects have come to light. Currently, China is the leading country for applying blockchain solutions to increase the use of green energy and create more environmentally friendly solutions. However, there are reasons to believe that soon other countries will follow, as the issue of global warming becomes more pressing.

## Topics to Discuss

* How can blockchain work with other technologies such as AI / ML / and IoT to help humans handle the threat of climate change?
* Are Open Web Solutions for Sustainable Development Goals a much needed addition to the existing stack of private climate solutions?
* Does Blockchain provide a way to combine climate change solutions to be both environmentally beneficial and commercially viable?
* How can the future of carbon tracking, trading, and clean energy creation integrate with open web infrastructure to create a better and more efficient system for handling climate change data?
* How can blockchain mitigate double spending problems in the carbon trading and clean energy marketplaces?
