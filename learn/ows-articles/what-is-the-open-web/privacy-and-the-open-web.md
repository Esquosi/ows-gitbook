# Privacy and the Open Web

Written by [4NTS](https://nearguilds.com/documentation/).&#x20;

Numerous data breaches in recent years, such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal, have prompted questions regarding how companies and governments should handle the information entrusted to them by their users. This in turn, has also intensified research into the development of new technologies that are better able to preserve the privacy of companies and users.

As a result, countries and legislators have rushed to establish new compliance requirements for user’s privacy and data collection - such as the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe and the Chinese’ Personal Information Protection Law. In parallel, a new trend of turning to new technologies such as blockchain to solve privacy issues has emerged. In this regard, contrary to the initial perception of many, blockchain technology could not only be GDPR-compatible, but help increase levels of data privacy and protection while also returning data ownership of that information to individuals. Therefore, blockchain technology can very much be used as a privacy tool.&#x20;

As a result of this value proposition, many players in the industry have started competing for leadership in numerous privacy related fields.

### Blockchain Technology as a Tool to Protect Privacy and Increase Security and Transparency.

As explained in the introduction, a blockchain is a decentralized network in which all the records are carved in a distributed manner and shared among different devices scattered around the world. The records are kept by all members of a blockchain, and network confirmations are executed at regular intervals, linking (chained and encrypted) to the previous existing blocks. This makes the logs immutable and inviolable.

With blockchain technology, instead of providing our information to centralized platforms/shops, we can store it within a decentralized ledger, free of single points of failure. That makes it possible to encode a significant number of interactions and increase reliability, eliminating the political and commercial risks associated with the process being managed by a central entity.

The fact that transactions are recorded on a blockchain in the form of a hash means there is a high degree of transparency while securing the content of the recorded transaction. Transactions recorded on the blockchain take on the format of an “alphanumeric code” (which includes the date and time). Thus, its structure provides transparency while simultaneously protecting the content recorded on the network. This alphanumeric code, or hash, is the equivalent of a “fingerprint” of a piece of data that exists outside of the blockchain network. The chances of two different transactions having the same hash recorded in a blockchain are virtually zero. Thus, transparency and confidentiality can be reconciled on a blockchain.

### Blockchain to Safeguard Political Freedoms and Prevent Power Imbalances.

As Shoshana Zuboff has pointed out in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, big tech companies have an unprecedented amount of control over people’s personal data. That creates a power imbalance between provider and consumer which jeopardizes people’s freedom in significant ways. Over the past years companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook have increasingly used their power to not only starve off competition - posing a threat to small size and medium size businesses- but also to interfere in the political life of citizens. The latest example of their power to interfere in political affairs is Facebook and Twitter’s decision to indefinitely suspend Donald Trump’s Twitter and Facebook account following the events at the Capitol, thus arrogating to themselves the right to take a decision on a public matter of the highest political importance.

Another troubling aspect of this state of affairs is that the amount of private data that these companies have access to allows them to get insights into patterns of human behavior, study emotional responses, and foresee future behavior with the help of big data analytics. This allows them to create better and more addictive products but also to develop techniques to trigger emotions and desires, and all without the consumer’s knowledge.&#x20;

The adoption of a technology that prevents tech giants from holding a disproportionate amount of power and information about people becomes crucial in order to safeguard people’s political freedoms and dignity – as well as ground a vision of a better more open future. Ultimately, the Open Web, and its core underlying technology blockchain, have the capacity to ground a pathway towards a society where privacy, freedom, and transparency are provided to its citizens. It is then crucial that its development is followed, discussed, and encouraged.

## A Roadmap of Future Opportunity.

Since its invention the web has increasingly become a space for engaging in politics, education, culture, science, and many other activities. However, the web has increasingly become a platform controlled by a select few that are focused on increasing their profits without enriching the lives of their users. As the Executive Director of the Mozilla Foundation, Mark Surman put it:

> “The open web is something we all depend on: to communicate and create, to work and play, to buy and sell. And like any other natural resource, it’s fragile. It needs care, because it can be polluted: by harassment and abuse, by misinformation, by bad public policy”.

Privacy is an essential component to guarantee a healthy open web environment and to foster more balanced communication between its users. Blockchain technology is already offering the means to fulfil this goal, and important developments can be seen in different areas.

### A New Era of Data Storage and Transactional Privacy.

Blockchain is the beginning of a new era of data storage and code execution that can stimulate new business models and markets while guaranteeing privacy and security. Anonymous cryptocurrencies are already providing the possibility to counter third party control over users’ data, thus hindering in important ways possibilities of surveillance. In most of the financial online transactions, users will be able to benefit from minimal disclosure of their transaction and account information. That means that users’ transactions will only be accessed by authorised users’, that the system administrator will not be able to disclose any information without their consent, and that all users’ data will be stored efficiently and securely even under unexpected failures.

Such level of confidentiality is not only desirable in the financial sector, and business sector but many non-financial areas as well. In particular in the governmental sector in which, presently, citizens retain little or no control over their data.

### Privacy Changes Across Industries.&#x20;

We are still in the early days of blockchain, but its development is soon going to affect various sectors, from the financial and governamental, to the social and environmental. Blockchain is soon going to be able to guarantee solutions to fight corruption, detect human rights violations, allow for supply chain’ transparency, and significantly reduce daunting bureaucratic procedures, just to mention a few.&#x20;

As blockchain will progressively allow people to retain more control over their data and to do away with intermediaries, it will necessarily lead us to re-think the role of institutions, the State, and think about new frameworks that will allow blockchain technology to be correctly and efficiently applied to everyone’s benefit.

## Future Topics to Discuss.

* Anonymous Cryptocurrencies and Financial Services (DEX’s)&#x20;
* Data Protection and Compliance&#x20;
* Open-Source Applications and User First Data Models (Users Give Permission)&#x20;
* The Open Web As A Response To Surveillance Capitalism&#x20;
* The Danger of Misappropriating a Blockchain for a Surveillance State
