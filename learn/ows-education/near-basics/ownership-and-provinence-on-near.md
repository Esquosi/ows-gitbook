# Ownership and Provinence on NEAR

Hello everyone! Welcome to the seventh and last chapter of ‘NEAR Basics’ issue which is a part of educational series created by the Open Web Sandbox team. In this part we will talk about Ownership and Provinence on NEAR and will mainly focus on ownership of NFT’s and look at several relevant projects from the NEAR Ecosystem. If you would like to know more about Ownership and Provinence on Blockchain in general, please check out our previous issue about ‘Blockchain Basics’.&#x20;

Let’s go!\

### NFT Projects on NEAR

NEAR Ecosystem is certainly rich with projects related to NFT’s. Right now there are 179 projects like that, among which 34 marketplaces and 68 collectibles. Marketplaces allow users to perform various actions on their NFT’s, such as collect, mint, trade or sell them. Collectibles are NFT’s categorised into collections; such collections usually attract more potential buyers.  All of them can be found on the [awesomenear.com](http://awesomenear.com) repository.

### Mintbase

Mintbase is a functional platform that allows anyone to mint NFT’s in just several clicks without being concerned with technical complexities. Main message here is that you do not need to be a developer to be able to mint an NFT. Even though we are used to NFT’s being used for art objects, founders believe that practical application of this technology in a daily life for stuff like tickets or memberships is extremely promising too. By making the creation process accessible to the broad public, Mintbase hopes to accelerate mass adoption of this technology.

### CURA

Cura is an experimental project on NEAR dedicated to creative coding - founders explore the possibilities of using NFT’s as creative tools. CURA is focused on facilitation of the creation of generative art (and so are many collectibles on NEAR in fact, like the [NEARnauts](https://awesomenear.com/nearnauts) for example).

Generative art is a form of art which is created with the use of an autonomous system, that is not under direct human control, like a computer system for example.&#x20;

An artist writes code where he defines a certain set of variables like the size, colour or lines and the algorithm creates artworks based on those variables. CURA is currently on testnet and the main goal of the project is to create a set of various tools like composable smart contracts or themed components and a free space to experiment for artists on NEAR.

### Paras

Paras is a digital art card marketplace for creators and collectors. Creators can create digital collections of their art and sell it right there too. Collectors are able to purchase cards and not worry about forgery due to the provable ownership provided by the technology. Interesting detail about Paras is that founders have opted for a curatorial approach on their platform: creators must apply to create cards on Paras and only 30 artists are picked per week. This ensures orderly flow and consistent quality of art works on Paras. Additionally, releases on Paras are always collection-based which allows artists to share multiple pieces of their work at once.

### Satori

Satori is another NFT platform built on NEAR. This platform allows artists to generate large numbers of NFT’s in one go and send them out to their fans immediately through the customised landing page or social media accounts, all that with no coding required. Minting on Satori is low-cost and very efficient which allows to engage the whole community in a single drop. Satori has also partnered with Shopify, a Web2 marketplace, which allows any Shopify user to mint and sell NFT collections in their existing Shopify store.

### Tamago

Tamago is a decentralized audio streaming platform built on NEAR. Like Spotify but so much cooler because this platform opts for the free market monetisation aiming to return the power and revenues back to the artists. Tamago is a bright example of a creators economy: zero gatekeeping and advertising present and creators receive 100% of returns and are able to build relationships with their listeners without a middlemen. There is also a marketplace on Tamago: artists have an options to set their music for sell as NFTs and set royalty fees and users can add their purchases to their own marketplace - great alternative to the shared playlist!

This is the final chapter of the third release of OWS Education ‘NEAR Basics’. In this part we talked about projects on NEAR focused on Ownership and Provenance. Topic for our next release is not yet defined and you can make a difference here. Please go to our discord channel and vote on your preferred topic for the next educational series. Bye!&#x20;
