# OWS Events & Activities

Welcome to another segment of the ‘OWS Basics’ batch, part of OWS Education.

In this chapter we will go over what events and activities OWS produces on a monthly basis, so you guys have a good understanding of how to stay in the loop with NEAR ecosystem related content.

All of our events and activities at the moment include:

* Weekly AMAs
* Monthly Parties
* OWS Education

### Weekly AMAs

#### When.

Every Wednesday live on YouTube, OWS hosts a 30-45 minute AMA with special guests. The guests include founders, creators or collaborators of projects and DApps from the NEAR ecosystem.&#x20;

#### Why.

The function of these events is to keep you up to date with the latest developments for those up and coming projects.

#### Where.

If you are interested in this, then check out our website’s [News & Announcements](https://www.openwebsandbox.org/#News-Announcements) section, or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenWebSandbox) to catch the live streams. You can ask the questions live, so make sure to attend. If you miss the live stream, then you can watch the recordings on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TUaIxZM1HbdI\_NLSwiDug) or read our AMA recaps on our [Medium](https://medium.com/open-web-sandbox-near/tagged/open-web-sandbox).

### Monthly Parties.

#### When.

At the end of each month OWS hosts a 1 hour event with special guests, called the monthly party. The guests include founders, creators or collaborators of projects and DApps from the NEAR ecosystem.

#### Why.

The conference style event is aimed at delving deeper into a blockchain topic that has seen prevalent development throughout the month in the NEAR ecosystem. The idea is to cover a general theme, say [DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hluvRM\_T-\_8\&list=PLsQrUFWz8qIjBLvugcsAsSG0CHaBsoFIr\&index=3\&t=2s), [DAOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Z2EWwYHzc\&list=PLsQrUFWz8qIjBLvugcsAsSG0CHaBsoFIr\&index=1\&t=2324s) or even the [metaverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i5546EqGlo\&list=PLsQrUFWz8qIjBLvugcsAsSG0CHaBsoFIr\&index=4\&t=1s), but also focus in on what NEAR players specifically are doing about it.

### OWS Education.

#### When.

Finally, OWS Education is a new activity OWS has begun this month. The plan is to release video and written documentation at the end of each month, where every month is dedicated to a new topic that we find is important to cover for OWS contributors and newcomers.

#### Why.

The aim of OWS Education is to produce educational content so that all contributors and newcomers will be able to fill those information and knowledge gaps, no matter their background or knowledge levels. The information that we will be covering will range from basic OWS procedures and terminology (like this segment), introductory blockchain and NEAR concepts, but also in the future more specific categories, like DeFi and NFTs, and how they work on NEAR.

#### Where.

All of this content will go under the `Learn` section of our OWS Docs (where you are now), so keep an eye out at the end of each month for new videos and documentation.

### Conclusion

In this chapter we covered what activities and events OWS provides to the NEAR ecosystem. Hopefully there is something appealing and informative there for all of you.\
This concludes the educational batch on OWS basics. We hope you now have a better understanding of what OWS is, what it does, and how you can become involved.
