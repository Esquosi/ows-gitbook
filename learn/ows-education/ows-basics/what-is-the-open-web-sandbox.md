The Open Web Sandbox is a human-centric digital hub for everyone wishing to engage with projects building on top of the NEAR protocol. Our team aims to encourage participation and collaboration by connecting independent contributors from all over the world with different activities in the NEAR Ecosystem — these are called ‘Opportunities’ and we will share more about how to become a contributor and how to engage with opportunities in the next chapters from this month’s release.

### OWS Story&#x20;

The Open Web Sandbox was launched in April 2021 as a playground for everyone wishing to engage with the NEAR ecosystem; today, 9 months later we are a large hub with an international team and more than 1000 active participants who work for different projects within the ecosystem like Aurora, Sputnik DAO, Metapool and many more...

### Mission&#x20;

The mission of the Open Web Sandbox narrows down to providing the necessary guidance for every newcomer who wishes to deploy their talents for the benefit of the NEAR ecosystem. This is truly an inclusive community for everyone who is passionate about innovation and Web3.

OWS team provides personal support to every newcomer through various communication channel and events; besides, members of our online community always meet newbies with open arms. You can read more about support options in the next few chapters.

### Vision

The Open Web Sandbox aspires to empower people across the globe to embark on the blockchain journey by providing a guided, accessible and fun space to learn about technology and the NEAR Protocol. We are here to help you build the first blocks of your Web3 adventure!

### Connection to NEAR Ecosystem&#x20;

The Open Web Sandbox is a community based organisation within the NEAR Protocol ecosystem and is powered by the NEAR Protocol. OWS was one of the first Guilds which emerged in the ecosystem. Our main responsibility within the NEAR ecosystem is to make sure no newcomer is left without attention, no talent is left unnoticed, and no opportunity is left unfilled.

In the next subpage we you can find detailed information about Communities in the NEAR Ecosystem.&#x20;
