# What is the Project Dashboard?

Welcome to another segment of the ‘OWS Basics’ batch, part of OWS Education.

In this subpage we will go over how you guys can engage with OWS through the [Project Dashboard](https://www.openwebsandbox.org/projects-dashboard). This will allow you to become involved in projects within the NEAR ecosystem, and earn NEAR in the process.

### What is it?

The Project Dashboard is a live and up-to-date list of all opportunities offered by OWS that contributors can view and apply for.

If a community or guild wants a project completed for their organisation, then they outsource the project through OWS, which is then put on the Project Dashboard.

### Who is it for?

The Project Dashboard is for those who are OWS contributors and wants to start engaging. A contributor is a member of the OWS community. To become a contributor you must simply fill out the [Contributor Form ](https://airtable.com/shr4is9xLFYTgjUmX)once.

So, if you are not a contributor yet, then fill out the form now! It only takes a couple of minutes. If you want more information about contributors and how to become one, please visit our chapter on ['What are OWS Contributors?'](what-are-ows-contributors.md).

Once you are a contributor of the OWS community, you can then apply for projects on the Project Dashboard.

### First look at the Project Dashboard.

Let’s take a first look at the Project Dashboard and how to apply for a project. You can browse the Project Dashboard by going to [openwebsandbox.org/project-dashboard](http://openwebsandbox.org/project-dashboard). &#x20;

From there you can see the status of each project, what you see there are what we call **Project Cards**.&#x20;

If the button is orange, then the project is still open and taking applicants, otherwise, if it is grey, it has been closed for processing.

By clicking on the **availability** button, a new page will open with a detailed description of the project task, we call these **Project Descriptions**.&#x20;

By clicking on the **Apply** button, a new tab will open, taking you to the **Project Application** form.&#x20;

### How to apply for a project.

To apply for a project you simply click on the **Availability** button, then on the **Apply** button, and finally fill in all of the required fields in the **Project Application** form.

Once you have applied, similarly to a typical job application, someone from our team will contact you if you are picked by us for the corresponding project.

Once you have completed the project you let us know and we will instruct you on how to make a AstroDAO payment request for the next available payment period (end of each month).

For more information on how to make an AstroDAO payment request, visit our [Payment Request Guideline](../../../earn/payment-request-guideline.md) page.&#x20;

### Conclusion

In this chapter we have shown how to navigate our Project Dashboard and how contributors can apply for projects. Hopefully this will help our community understand all of the necessary steps to become part of the NEAR ecosystem. In the next subpage we will discuss what communication channels OWS has for you guys to be in contact with us.&#x20;
