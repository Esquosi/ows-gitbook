# OWS Communication Channels

Welcome to another segment of the ‘OWS Basics’ batch, part of OWS Education.

In this subpage we will go over what communication channels there are for OWS, so you guys have a good understanding of all of the ways in which you can contact us.

## Communication Channels.

### Website

Our central communication channel is our website. This is our first point of contact from which all other communication channels and OWS operations can be reached. The website is divided into two main parts, the main website and the OWS docs.

#### Main website

The main [website](https://www.openwebsandbox.org) is where you can read about what OWS does, what's new in the OWS ecosystem in terms of news or events, who the team is composed of, and of course a contact form for any questions or concerns.

The other great feature of our main website is the [Project Dashboard](https://www.openwebsandbox.org/projects-dashboard), where all of our project opportunities are listed, and where you can apply to partake in a project.

For more information about the dashboard and how to use it, please view the subpage on ['What is the Project Dashboard?'](what-is-the-project-dashboard.md).

#### OWS Docs

On the other hand, the role of the [OWS Docs](https://docs.openwebsandbox.org) section of the website (where you are currently reading from) is to be a repository for all OWS related documentation. This split into sections.&#x20;

* The `Engage` section documents how to engage with us, whether you are a contributor or a community.
* The `Earn` section  is for step-by-step documentation on how to earn NEAR through OWS.
* The `Learn` section is where we post educational documentation such as OWS Education, which includes our tutorials, and any other content by us or collaborators of OWS.
* The `Legal` section is where we keep all of our legal documentation, should you be interested in finding out more about our legal wrapper.

### Social Media

The second form of exposure OWS has is through all of its social media channels. These include Discord, the NEAR Forum, Twitter, YouTube, and Medium.

#### Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/U4PAG4NCna) is where OWS Contributors keep up-to-date with, ask questions, and discuss OWS and NEAR related content and activities. OWS is all about creating a growing and prospering community of people who genuinely want to engage with the general NEAR ecosystem.

#### Discord Language Hubs

The language hub channels on our Discord provide a welcoming environment for more than just English speaking people. Our discord server currently hubs channels in Russian, Spanish, Vietnamese, and Indian.

#### NEAR Forum

The [NEAR Forum](https://gov.near.org) has a much more important role to play in the NEAR ecosystem than people think. The role of it is to be the central communication channel for any NEAR related decision making. This acts as an informational database, where all NEAR decisions are meant to be recorded for the whole community to see and be involved in. This is what we call ‘political decentralisation’: decentralised and transparent decision making. Make sure you make an account and keep up to date with the topics you want to have a say in. Check out our OWS forum page [here](https://gov.near.org/c/open-web-sandbox/59).&#x20;

#### Twitters/YouTube/Medium.

****[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/OpenWebSandbox) is where we post everything about news and events run by OWS, but not only. Because of high activity, we have created ‘[OWS Events’](https://twitter.com/OWS\_Events), which is a Twitter account dedicated only to OWS events. &#x20;

If you want to know more about OWS events, then head to the [OWS Events and Activities](ows-events-and-activities.md) subsection.

****[**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TUaIxZM1HbdI\_NLSwiDug) is where we host and post all OWS video events, both weekly AMAs, monthly parties, and the occasional extra event. So if you ever miss anything, this is the place to visit.

****[**Medium**](https://medium.com/open-web-sandbox-near/tagged/open-web-sandbox) is where we post all written information by the OWS Team. At the moment we post weekly AMA recaps and monthly party recaps. We also post additional content, so follow us on it and stay up to date with NEAR news.

### Conclusion

In this chapter we covered what communication channels OWS provides, so that our community can have a variety of options depending on their needs. In the next video, we will explain what events and activities OWS organises through these communication channels, so that our community of contributors can stay up to date with NEAR ecosystem news, whilst being engaged in a fun and inclusive way.
