# Identity and Decision-Making on Blockchains

Welcome to the fourth piece of the ‘Blockchain Basics’ batch which is a part of OWS Education created by OWS team. In this article we will look into how users can maintain an identity on blockchain systems and how they can make decisions using those identities in a decentralised way. Let’s get started.

Essentially, identity and decision-making refers to the ability of a user or group of users to maintain an identity within the blockchain system and have decision making power using that identity. While this is already done in traditional computing systems, it is not done in a decentralised way.

### Wallets&#x20;

In blockchain systems, wallets are what allows users to make decisions on-chain, including sending and receiving funds, and using DApps - all actions that create transactions.

#### Why you need a wallet.

Any user that wants to take part in the capabilities of a blockchain must create a wallet. Wallets allow users to make transactions. Remember that for general purpose blockchains, transactions can be either cryptocurrency transfers or function calls to the virtual machine that the blockchain uses.

#### What wallets are.

A wallet is simply a combination of keys, a public and private one. A public key is the unique address to your wallet used to identify your wallet publicly. This key can be shown or sent to others safely and is used to direct transactions your way. On the other hand the private key is the secret password used to access your wallet, which is used to verify to the public that it is you that is making the transaction.

#### Types of wallets.

1. **App / Website Wallets.**

App and website wallets are the easiest, most user-friendly and accessible kind. The wallet keys are kept on the app or website, giving you accessibility but limited security. The private keys are stored on either online host servers or offline local drives. Having even an indirect connection to the internet is potentially risky. With the private key, a user can execute actions on the blockchain using your wallet identity.

2\. **Physical / Hardware Wallets.**\

This type of wallet is the most secure but least accessible wallet option. They offer the highest security compared to other wallet options. This wallet resembles a USB drive. When the wallet is not connected to a computer, the keys are completely offline and security is not compromised. The device stores your private keys which give you access to your funds. Once connected to a computer, the wallet requires a code to gain access, which can then be used to access and manage transactions.

### DAO's&#x20;

Similarly to wallets, DAOs allow users to make decisions on-chain. Their difference is that their decision-making process is distributed to a cooperative of users, instead of any single individual. The members of a DAO are said to be part of the DAO’s ‘council’. The size of the council, who is part of it, or the role of its members are flexible features decided by the DAO creators and voted in by its members. In brief, DAOs are a specific type of DApp that allows council members to make decisions through voting about the functioning of the smart contracts the DAO is composed of.

#### DAO Governance

DAO Governance is the level and type of interaction the members of a DAO council have over the activities of the DAO. Let’s break this down. When a DAO is put in place a structure must be implemented to determine the interactions possible by the members involved. DAO structures are immutably set in smart contracts. Once these structures are set, there is still decision making and interaction left for humans to partake in: this is what is meant by DAO Governance. It is the process of voting by the council members.

In this piece we understood how users can use blockchains to create an identity and make decisions using that identity, whether it transferring funds or making function calls. Or, if the users are part of a council, how DAO council members can make collective decisions about the present and future of their DAOs. In the next article we will discuss how money and finance is managed on blockchains.\
