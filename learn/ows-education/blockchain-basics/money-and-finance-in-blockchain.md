# Money and Finance in Blockchain

Welcome to the fifth part of the ‘Blockchain Basics’ batch which is a part of OWS Education created by OWS team. In this article we will look into money and finance on blockchains. Let’s get started!

Essentially, money and finance refers to the ability of a user to have access to financial services in a decentralised manner. On blockchains this is called Decentralised Finance, or DeFi. Let’s talk about this further.

### DeFi

#### What is DeFi?

DeFi stands for decentralised finance. In contrast to centralised finance, the kind of finance we are used to in everyday life like banking, exchanges, and financial service providers, which utilise centralised software and servers, DeFi utilises decentralised smart contracts which function on a decentralised blockchain data-structure.

#### What can DeFi do?

DeFi eliminates the requirement of trusting centralised entities with investments and fund custody, allowing a user of DeFi to directly interact with investment tools and services using a digital wallet (with minimal to no fees). Users which have funds in these wallets on blockchain networks can use DApps (Decentralised Applications) to lend, borrow, stake, liquid stake, farm or exchange cryptocurrencies. Let’s go through these terms.

* **Lending and borrowing** is the same as in the traditional sense, and is done by companies like BlockFi.
* **Staking** is when a user delegates tokens to a validator node part of a blockchain that uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol, receiving rewards as a return.
* **Liquid staking** is when a user delegates tokens to a liquid staker which strategically distributes tokens to a selection of validator nodes to maximise returns.
* **Farming** is when a user delegates tokens to a yield farmer which strategises a maximally profitable scheme amongst different DeFi DApps: such as staking, liquidity pools, lending, and borrowing.

### Exchanges&#x20;

#### What they are.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are digital service providers used to exchange between fiat currency and cryptocurrency, similar to an exchange for international currencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges are primarily used for cryptocurrency trading, similar to stock exchanges and use a centrally managed order-book structure to fill orders.

#### What they are used for.

The only way to buy or sell cryptocurrency for fiat is to use a crypto exchange. You can also store currencies on exchanges, with an increasing amount of financial services being added.

### DEX's

#### What they are.

While exchanges for FIAT/crypto swaps are centralised, Decentralised Exchanges (or DEX’s) use Automatic Market Makers (AMMs) on smart contracts, so that their order fills and management is decentralised and autonomous.

#### What they are used for.

Their use is to exchange only between cryptocurrencies. While some DEXs may offer additional DeFi services, their primary role is to provide liquidity to users who want to exchange tokens.

### Risks of DeFi

The risk of using financial services with no intermediaries is that there is limited insurance from hacks, smart contract errors, user errors, unbalanced pools, and depreciative token values. So, centralised finance is in some sense safer, but returns on investments are typically lower. On the other hand, DeFi allows users to totally control their funds, disabling the ability of intermediaries to freeze or close accounts, or be secretive about the technical structure of their services.

In this part we talked about money and finance on blockchain systems. It is indeed possible to use blockchain technology to create an array of financial services, while avoiding centralised custodians of such services. While finance for the large part concerns fungible tokens, in the next article we will talk how non-fungible-tokens on blockchains allow ownership of other types of digital assets and their provenance.
