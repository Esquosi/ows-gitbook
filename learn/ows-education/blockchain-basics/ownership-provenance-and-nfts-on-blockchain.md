# Ownership, Provenance and NFT's on Blockchain

Welcome to the sixth and final part of the ‘Blockchain Basics’ batch which is a part of OWS Education, created by OWS team. In this piece we will look into ownership and provenance in blockchains. Let’s get started!

### Ownership and Provenance

Essentially, ownership and provenance refer to the ability of a user to prove ownership and have access to transparent provenance of that ownership in a decentralised manner. As discussed in the very first video from this batch, Web1 was about just consuming, Web2 allows users to consume and co-create and Web3 adds the third component to the equation: ownership. Because we have already talked about how users can manage fungible tokens, for example, cryptocurrencies, using their wallet identity, what we would like to talk about here is the ownership of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.

### NFT's

#### What are they?

NFTs refer to digital items that are recognisable individually due to their unique identification codes and metadata that is stored on a blockchain and are not exchangeable in a like-for-like manner by other items of the same group, like cryptocurrencies. NFT technology first became available in 2014, however, the trend has really exploded among the broader audience in 2021.

#### How are they created?

Nowadays anyone is able to tokenise any digital asset and turn it into an NFT in just several mouse clicks by connecting their wallet to the preferred NFT marketplace and paying a certain service fee. The process itself is called ‘minting’. Behind the scenes, at the moment of creation of an NFT, unique identification code and metadata of the digital asset gets saved in the blockchain ledger forever and it is impossible to edit or delete it.\
Most well-known NFT marketplaces are based on Ethereum blockchain and charge rather high service fees; example of such marketplaces are Rarible, OpenSea or Nifty Gateway. There are also cheaper places to mint your NFT’s like for example Mintbase based on NEAR Protocol or Solana-based Solsea.

#### What are they used for?

In theory, anything that is unique and needs provable ownership can be tuned into an NFT. However, some real-world applications might better explain what this means.

* Art

Firstly, this technology democratises the art industry by allowing artists and creators to have full control and ownership of their creations that can be always traced back to them - this means that they can trade their work themselves and receive a fair payment for it, omitting the intermediaries. There is also an option to claim royalties from any resale of their art pieces in the future.

* Physical Assets

Besides, NFT’s oftentimes represent real-word physical assets like real estate or art pieces and are backed by insurances, warranties and legal obligations. In cases like that tokenization allows to trace ownership easily which reduces the probability of fraud and therefore makes selling, buying or trading these assets more efficient.

* Identity Management

Finally, NFT’s have a good potential to assist in personal identity management, seeing as they contain codes with a unique piece of information that cannot be forged. Any personal document like passports, drivers licenses or even a university degree could be turned into an NFT that will help to prove the authenticity of the digital item.

In this article we discussed ownership and provenance on blockchain and looked into this subject through the NFT lens. This is the final chapter of the ‘Blockchain basics’ release made by the OWS team. We hope you enjoyed these articles!&#x20;
