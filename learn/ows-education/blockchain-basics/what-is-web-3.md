# What is Web 3?

Welcome to the first segment of the ‘Blockchain Basics’ batch, part of OWS Education.

In this article we take a look at Web 3.

To understand what Web 3 is, it’s better to look at the evolution of the internet since its inception. To do this, we must go back to Web 1.

### Web 1

The first version of the internet in the 1990’s is referred to as the read-only version. This initial version was comprised of simple homepages and hyperlinks, giving users the ability to surf pages of content using links. This was as close to a digital version of magazines as possible, where there was very limited functionality given to the users, and the barrier to entry to be able to write content was similar to that of traditional publishing. From the users perspective, reading content was the main purpose of the internet at that time.

### Web 2

The second version of the internet in the following decade is referred to as the read-write version. Web 2 gave users the ability to not only view content, but also produce, edit and publish content on the internet. This reduced the barriers to entry for what was allowed to be published on the internet. This saw the development of all of the applications and websites we know of today, from internet forums, blogs, marketplaces, and finally, social media sites.\
What is important to consider for Web 2 is: where is the content that people produce stored? who is it stored by? who owns it? The answers to these questions raise concerns about web2.\


#### Where is data computed and stored?

Users create the content: actions, text, images, edits, or data. The software then processes this content running on virtual machines, storing the data in databases which run on servers. This is an example of how data is stored in a centralised manner.

#### Who stores and controls the data?

For the most part, private companies are the custodians of data, virtual machines, and databases. Private companies are also the custodians of the server hardware that runs the software, virtual machine, and databases. This is an example of how data is stored by centralised organisations.

#### Who owns the data?

Depending on their privacy policy, private companies at some level own the data or metadata that is stored in their databases. Due to this, the companies are able to sell this data to other companies within their legal bounds.\
Ok, let’s now move on to Web 3.

### Web 3.

The third version of the internet, which began at the end of the 2010’s, is referred to as the read-write-own version. Web 3 allows users to not only produce content, but also own content on the internet without any dependence on private companies. This aims to reduce the risk associated with centralising data. Web 3 has seen the development of software like cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and peer-to-peer systems.\


What is important for Web 3 is: how can we solve the current centralisation issues with computation, data storage, and data ownership? &#x20;

#### Where is data computed and stored?

Users create the content that goes into DApps and their smart contracts, whether its actions, text, images, transactions, or data. Similarly to Web 2, the smart contracts that process this content run on decentralised virtual machines. Decentralised virtual machines store all of their data on decentralised blockchain databases. This is an example of how Web 3 stores data in a decentralised manner.

#### Who stores and controls the data?

Unlike Web 2, the role of DApps is to autonomously store data on blockchains, which are not controlled by any entity. This is an example of how Web 3 data is controlled in a decentralised manner.

#### Who owns the data?

The data is transparently stored on blockchains, but its content is owned by the users. Users can become participant shareholders of Web 3 DApps or DAOs, or own content on these platforms. Owning cryptocurrencies, tokens, or NFTs is how users can become owners of data, giving them the right to ownership.\


In this text we gave a brief comparison of Web 1, Web 2, and Web 3. We established where and by who data is stored, and who owns it for both Web 2 and Web 3. Now we understand what Web 3 is and why it’s important for the development of the internet.

To look into blockchain technology as an instance of Web 3, we must first see what problems blockchain technology faces, so that we can later see how it's doing in trying to solve these problems.

The next section will give a brief introduction to the Blockchain Trilemma.
