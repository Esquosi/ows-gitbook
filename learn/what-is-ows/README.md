# What is OWS?

A human-centric digital hub for everyone wishing to engage with projects building on top of the NEAR protocol. The Open Web Sandbox is a community based organisation within the NEAR Protocol ecosystem.

Our mission is to facilitate collaboration between communities that seek to create opportunities through projects, and contributors who want to take those opportunities and contribute to the ecosystem.
