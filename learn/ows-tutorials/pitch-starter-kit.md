How to get funding through the NEAR Forum.&#x20;
{% endembed %}

### **Who is this document for?**

This document is for people, contributors or communities who have an idea for a project or have started one already and are looking for long term or short term funding to get themselves off the ground.

\
To get funding within the NEAR ecosystem, an individual or representative of an organisation must make a post on the NEAR forum. This post must detail various pieces of information.

\
The following document is a guide template that should be used to structure the post on the NEAR Forum so that the request can be processed more effectively.

| If you are a:          | Post in the following Forum subcategory:                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Guild**              | [Open Web Sandbox](https://gov.near.org/c/open-web-sandbox/59) |
| **Creative guild/DAO** | [Creatives DAO](https://gov.near.org/c/creatives/47)           |
| **Development**        | [Development](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/22)                   |
| **Marketing**          | [Marketing DAO](https://gov.near.org/c/marketing/26)           |
| **Education**          | [Education](https://gov.near.org/c/education/33)               |
| **Other**              | [Community](https://gov.near.org/c/community/10)               |

### **Where does funding come from?**

There are hundreds of funding DAOs on the NEAR [Astro DAO](https://astrodao.com). This makes it difficult for a guild, project or contributor to find the right DAO to fund their proposals. There are two main ways to find the appropriate DAO.

* [**NEAR Community Fund**](https://gov.near.org/t/near-community-fund/2819): a decentralised community fund of NEAR tokens for the community to redistribute democratically through DAOs. The [NEAR Governance Forum](https://gov.near.org/c/gov/6) offers an overview of how the community fund is progressing, what it is giving funding to, and what funding is available.
* [**NEAR Grants**](https://near.org/grants/): a centralised program by the [NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation/) necessary for efficient and directed development of more integral parts of the NEAR ecosystem. If you are a project or DApp and want long term support, then the NEAR Grants program might be the right choice.
